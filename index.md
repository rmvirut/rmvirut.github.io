# Hi, I'm Kojo

I'm an IT Consultant/Specialist. That's because I enjoy solving problems and even more so with technology. If a store wants to go into e-commerce, I analyse from all angles how to best pull that off from which system to use (Drupal, Wordpress or Shopify), when to go online and what's the approach to take. If an business's email server is running out of storage, I'll help archive the oldest mails and have a discussion on whether we should expand the capacity and automate the archiving system.

Basically, I find everyday business challenges and problems, research and determine what's the best way to overcome them.
