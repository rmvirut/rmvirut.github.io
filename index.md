## Hi, I'm Kojo
I'm the owner of Diji Domain IT Services, the registered name I freelance under.
I've worked on various IT projects usually with new businesses that need help with IT from web development, hardware recommendation and sourcing to conducting business analysis to proposing solutions.

I currently work full-time as sales associate with The Source (Bell 
Electronics) where I peform duties similar to consulting.

<<<<<<< HEAD
I'm an IT Consultant/Specialist. That's because I enjoy solving problems and even more so with technology. If a store wants to go into e-commerce, I analyse from all angles how to best pull that off from which system to use (Drupal, Wordpress or Shopify), when to go online and what's the approach to take. If an business's email server is running out of storage, I'll help archive the oldest mails and have a discussion on whether we should expand the capacity and automate the archiving system.

Basically, I find everyday business challenges and problems, research and determine what's the best way to overcome them.
=======
I'm actively seeking to opportunities IT related fields like development or general specialist. Willing to work on contract or on a full-time basis as required.
