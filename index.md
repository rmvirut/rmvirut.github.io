## Hi, I'm Kojo
And I like to build full IT solutions for my clients.

I've worked on various IT projects usually with new businesses that need help with IT from web development, hardware recommendation and sourcing to conducting business analysis to proposing solutions. They're been anywhere from setting an online store to setting up security cameras.

I enjoy solving problems and even more so with technology.
