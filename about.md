# About Me

I'll start with my name. My name's Kojo Acquah and I was born and raised in Ghana
but I've been a Canadian resident as of September 9, 2014. However, since meeting
Jesus Christ and having my whole life transformed I like to introduce myself as
a man born and raised in Ghana, African by heritage, Canadian on paper (soon),
Heaven-bound by promise (thank you Jesus) and above all else, a friend of God.

Some might consider this crazy, but I welcome and respect this sentiment and most
importantly welcome any and all who would like to hear more of my testimony as
a young Chrisitan teen that had his own personal encounter with the Lord. But
enough about that.
