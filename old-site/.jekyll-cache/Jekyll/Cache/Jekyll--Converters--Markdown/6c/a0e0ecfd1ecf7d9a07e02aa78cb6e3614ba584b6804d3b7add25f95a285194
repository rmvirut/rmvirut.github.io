I"“<h2 id="hi-im-kojo">Hi, Iâ€™m Kojo</h2>
<p>Iâ€™m the owner of <a href="https://dijidomain.business.site/">Diji Domain IT Services</a>, the registered name I freelance under.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve worked on various IT projects usually with new businesses that need help with IT from web development, hardware recommendation and sourcing to conducting business analysis to proposing solutions.</p>

<p>I currently work full-time as sales associate with The Source (Bell 
Electronics) where I peform duties similar to consulting.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m an IT Consultant/Specialist. Thatâ€™s because I enjoy solving problems and even more so with technology. If a store wants to go into e-commerce, I analyse from all angles how to best pull that off from which system to use (Drupal, Wordpress or Shopify), when to go online and whatâ€™s the approach to take. If an businessâ€™s email server is running out of storage, Iâ€™ll help archive the oldest mails and have a discussion on whether we should expand the capacity and automate the archiving system.</p>

<p>Basically, I find everyday business challenges and problems, research and determine whatâ€™s the best way to overcome them.</p>
