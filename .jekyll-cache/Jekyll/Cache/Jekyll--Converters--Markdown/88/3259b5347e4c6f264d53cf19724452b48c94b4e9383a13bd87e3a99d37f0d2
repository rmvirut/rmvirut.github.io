<p>I enjoy solving problems and even more so with technology. If a store wants to go into e-commerce, I like to analyse from all angles how to best pull that off. If an business’s email server is running out of storage, I’ll help archive the oldest mail and have a discussion on whether we should expand the capacity and automate the archiving system.</p>

<p>Basically, I find everyday business challenges and problems, research and determine what’s the best way to overcome them.</p>
