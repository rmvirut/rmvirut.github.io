<p>Iâ€™m an IT Consultant/Specialist. Thatâ€™s because I enjoy solving problems and even more so with technology. If a store wants to go into e-commerce, I analyse from all angles how to best pull that off from which system to use (Drupal, Wordpress or Shopify), when to go online and whatâ€™s the approach to take. If an businessâ€™s email server is running out of storage, Iâ€™ll help archive the oldest mails and have a discussion on whether we should expand the capacity and automate the archiving system.</p>

<p>Basically, I find everyday business challenges and problems, research and determine whatâ€™s the best way to overcome them.</p>
