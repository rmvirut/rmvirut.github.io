I"<h1 id="about-me">About Me</h1>

<p>Iâ€™ll start with my name. My nameâ€™s Kojo Acquah and I was born and raised in Ghana
but Iâ€™ve been a Canadian resident as of September 9, 2014. However, since meeting
Jesus Christ and having my whole life transformed I like to introduce myself as
a man born and raised in Ghana, African by heritage, Canadian on paper (soon),
Heaven-bound by promise (thank you Jesus) and above all else, a friend of God.</p>

<p>Some might consider this crazy, but I welcome and respect this sentiment and most
importantly welcome any and all who would like to hear more of my testimony as
a young Chrisitan teen that had his own personal encounter with the Lord. But
Â«Â«Â«&lt; HEAD
enough about that.

enough about that (sadly) and unto me as a professional.</p>

<h2 id="moving-on">Moving On</h2>

<p>Personally thereâ€™s too much to put on this page. Iâ€™ve lived a rich a and extremely
fulfilling life, especially regarding the fact that Iâ€™m (at the time of publishing)
only 24 years old (born â€˜95). Iâ€™ve met people from around the world thanks to my
dadâ€™s line of work and also gained exposure to even more cultures besides my own
before and after relocating to Canada. Itâ€™s pretty exciting. Sadly, I might also
be on the autism spectrum thus Iâ€™m currently looking into seeing a professional
at some point</p>

<h2 id="the-timeline">The Timeline</h2>
