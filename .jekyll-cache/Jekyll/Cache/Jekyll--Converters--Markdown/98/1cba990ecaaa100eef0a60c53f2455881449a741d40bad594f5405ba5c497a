<h1 id="first-thing-to-know-about-me">First Thing To Know About Me</h1>

<p>This site is meant to be a professional portfolio and project showcase for my 
career as an IT Consultant. But I also like to let people know me for more than
how good I am at analysing and resolving business problems using tech (nice healine, huh?).</p>

<p>I’ll start with my name. My name’s Kojo Acquah and I was born and raised in Ghana
but currently reside in Canada as of September 9, 2014. However, since meeting 
Jesus Christ and having my whole life transformed I like to introduce myself as 
a man born and raised in Ghana, African by heritage, Canadian on paper (soon),
Heaven-bound by promise (thank you Jesus) and above all else, a friend of God.</p>

<p>Some might consider this crazy, but I welcome and respect this sentiment and most 
importantly welcome any and all who would like to hear more of my testimony as 
a young Chrisitan teen that had his own personal encounter with the Lord. But 
enough about that (sadly) and unto me as a professional.</p>

<p>Personally there’s too much to put on this page. I’ve lived a rich a and extremely
fulfilling life, especially regarding the fact that I’m (at the time of publishing)
only 24 years old (born ‘95). I’ve met people from around the world thanks to my
dad’s line of work and also gained exposure to even more cultures besides my own
before and after relocating to Canada. It’s pretty exciting. Sadly, I might also
be on the autism spectrum thus I’m currently looking into seeing a professional 
at some point</p>
