I"Ð<h1 id="hi-im-kojo">Hi, Iâ€™m Kojo</h1>

<p>I enjoy solving problems and even more so with technology. If a store wants to go into e-commerce, I like to analyse from all angles how to best pull that off. If an businessâ€™s email server is running out of storage, Iâ€™ll help archive the oldest mail and have a discussion on whether we should expand the capacity and automate the archiving system.</p>

<p>Basically, I find everyday business challenges and problems, research and determine whatâ€™s the best way to overcome them.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m actively looking for new opportunities in any IT related fields or projects. And feel free to contact me if youâ€™re looking to hire a freelancer for something interesting.</p>
