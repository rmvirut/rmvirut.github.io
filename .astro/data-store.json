The business is an upcoming\r\nHalifax-based retailer specialising in hair extensions, both human and artificial. Disclaimer,\r\nshe’s a friend of mine.\r\n\r\nThe business has been in operation for roughly 2-3 years, as of writing, and has\r\nsince slowly grown its clientele in the HRM region and even outside the province of Nova\r\nScotia. Suffice to say it’s growing and with that growth came the wake up call to adapt for the\r\nsake of its ever increasing customers and business volume.\r\n\r\n## Business Challenges\r\n\r\nWhen we started the project, we discovered at the interview stage that an\r\ne-commerce site wouldn’t be enough so we couldn’t settle for just a new website. I like to\r\nremind my clients that this is the difference between hiring a web developer/programmer vs\r\nan IT consultant/business analyst. Right away, she agreed we needed something more than\r\njust a website; we needed a system that would be a solution to all the following challenges:\r\n\r\n1. Cost: When it comes to business, cost cannot definitely come into play. In this\r\nparticular situation the budget was very limited and so we had to work with what we\r\nhad. My client had some great ideas and vision for her business and the project itself\r\nbut the cost was a determining factor in what she could have and when.\r\n\r\n2. Time: HfxExtension was looking to a 2020 New Year’s launch ceremony and had\r\ndecided to proceed with the idea of going online sometime mid-November. This left\r\nus with a little over 45 days to determine the project’s scope and requirements,\r\ndesign and implement a solution, test it and debug then finally go live all by the first\r\nweek of January, 2020. I can set up a full, five page website with all the bells and\r\nwhistles in under 3 hours. However, when it comes to developing long term solutions\r\nfor business processes, you want to have more time on your hands.\r\n\r\n3. Inventory Management: As with all businesses, with the growth comes a need for\r\nbetter tools to organize and deliver to its customers. Before the start of the project,\r\nHfxExtensions didn’t have an inventory system in place. Like most student-owned\r\nbusinesses at the time, everything was entirely by hand and memory which worked\r\nfor a time until the number of orders and requests from clients began to grow.\r\n\r\n4. Tracking and analytics: Without an inventory system in place, inventory tracking\r\nalso became virtually impossible if not difficult. It’s one thing not knowing exactly how\r\nmany hair extensions and which type you have on hand and a whole other challenge\r\nnot knowing which products are selling and who's buying what.\r\n\r\n5. Electronic Payment Transaction: The last challenge that needed addressing was\r\nthe payment methods that were in place at the time. Prior to deciding to set up an\r\ne-commerce store, most of the business was processed through interac and cash\r\nwhich, as a fellow business owner, I knew was difficult to keep track of unless there\r\nwas a deliberate setup that separated the business’ accounting from the owner’s\r\npersonal funds. In Canada, if you’re operating as a business under a different name\r\nother than yours, separate bank accounts and bookkeeping are required for tax\r\nreasons.\r\nSee: [Small businesses and self-employed income](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed-income.html)\r\n\r\nUsually I would include the knowledge barrier as another challenge we had to prepare for\r\nhowever, thankfully my client was well informed with technology it was a quick walkthrough\r\nwhen it came to training.\r\n\r\n## Solution Story\r\n\r\nWordpress and WooCommerce were the combination that came to mind as the\r\nchallenges were being outlined. I have experience with Drupal 8 and pre-Adobe magento\r\nback when it was entirely open source. While magento specializes in creating e-commerce\r\nexperiences, this was a case of using a backhoe for a shovel’s job. Drupal was also a fairly\r\ntempting option considering I had recently gotten used to the platform and grown rather\r\nattached to it. However, besides the issue of the learning curve of Drupal & Drupal\r\nCommerce, the platform was in both the early days and latter days of transitioning from\r\nDrupal 7 to 8 and then 9 and with no automated upgrade procedure in place, the cost of an\r\nadditional upgrade even from 8 to 9 just wasn’t worth it. But Wordpress had all we wanted\r\nand none of what we didn’t want;\r\n\r\n1. Fast and easy setup with low-cost entry barrier\r\n2. Easy upgrade process between major versions\r\n3. WooCommerce extension allows for adding a shopping feature to the website\r\n4. Large and diverse extension marketplace\r\n5. Large and active community that’s not showing any signs of slowing down\r\n6. Relatively small learning curve\r\n\r\nNow with the platform settled on, it came with a lot of features that helped us address\r\nsome of the challenges we encountered.\r\n\r\nWordpress’ only cost of entry, minus developer fees, were hosting and we managed\r\nto lock in a great deal with one of my recommended hosting providers, HostPapa. For a first\r\ntime online business, this was a great feature that minimized risk to my client’s finances by\r\nreducing the cost altogether. Besides this, we also opted for the milestone approach for the\r\nproject where we break down a client’s project idea/vision into two parts, functions and\r\nforms. The functions are the features that allow a client to start and continue operating their\r\ncore business and the forms are those that only serve to improve it after. In this case, Hfx\r\nExtension could do without a custom-developed theme, dropshipping, worldwide shipping\r\netc. The essentials were to have an operational online platform to showcase her products\r\nand process transactions. Once we agreed on this, we proceeded to select a\r\nwoocommerce-compatible theme that was easily customizable and combined it with a few\r\nextensions to create the experience my client was looking to give her customers.\r\nWith regards to time, while I was used to 90 timelines for such projects, doing this in\r\n45 days became much easier due to the reduction in the workload from breaking it down and\r\nalthough it did take some extra hours past 5 to get things in place, it was well worth it.\r\nMoving on to inventory management. Considering businesses can (and should) now\r\nbe entirely cloud-based, we decided to use WooCommerce for all inventory instead of\r\nprocuring a separate application to do this. This would reduce fragmentation and reduce cost\r\nand time of development. It’s nice to have specialized systems in place for each business\r\ntask/process. However, when it’s a single person running everything, you want to eliminate\r\nthe feeling of being all over the place. This also serves to preserve data integrity by\r\neliminating redundancy across platforms.\r\nFinally, for payments, we decided on a combination of Paypal and Square’s APIs to\r\nprocess payments during transactions. Square was included as a special request from the\r\nclient to process payments both online and in-person including contactless and interac\r\nduring events like expos.\r\n\r\n## Results\r\n\r\nAs with all my clients, I do my best to maintain a close relationship with them and occasionally\r\ncheck on them occasionally to ensure things are going well and that seems to be the case\r\nwith Hfx.\r\n\r\nThis is the impact we’ve had on the business since setting up this website:\r\n\r\n- Increased reach and, effectively sales, by increasing accessibility to customers\r\n- Comprehensive organization and tracking for transactions and sales volumes.\r\n- Visitor tracking and conversion analytics\r\n- Provided the owner with real-time inventory tracking per product and, for customers,\r\nreal-time inventory updates\r\n- Double-digit percentage increase in revenue due to increased reach and conversion\r\n- Better/improved customer relations management across email and social media\r\nthrough detailed product organization, description and FAQ pages to provide more\r\ninfo\r\n\r\n\u003Cblockquote class=\"blockquote\"> “Since I got the website, it’s been easier to manage and they’ve (her clients) been receptive to it.” \u003Cdiv class=\"blockquote-source\">Jennifer Kpolu, Owner\u003C/div>\r\n\u003C/blockquote>\r\n\r\nWithin the 45 day deadline, we were able to have a new, mobile-friendly e-commerce\r\nsolution up and running and we managed to get more than just a pretty homepage and some\r\nproducts online. HfxExtension is now able to cater to clients across Canada and is still\r\nworking on plans to expand into US markets with time.\r\n\r\nHer bookkeeping headaches are all but gone with Wordpress + Square generating\r\ninvoices and keeping an accurate history of all transactions on and offline. This also works\r\ngreat for her clients who now have receipts for every purchase and the ability to order from\r\nanywhere in Canada, for now.\r\n\r\nYou can visit [HfxExtension.com](https://hfxextensions.com/) here to checkout the site and perhaps signup as a customer to support the business.","src/blog/hfxextensions.md","720bea5b7efc438a",{"html":19,"metadata":20},"\u003Ch2 id=\"about-the-client\">About the Client\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>HfxExtensions is the brainchild of Ms Jennifer Kpolu.
