            My name is Kojo Acquah. I was born and raised in Ghana in a rather lovely Christian family. We went to churh
            almost every Sunday and by all account were considered a pretty decent family. The kids' grades were good,
            you would not believe how popular I made my family amongst the other parents and teachers, not to mention my
            sister. It was a good life; I almost never lacked and if I really wanted somehting, I only needed to ask. If
            the answer was no, sometimes a tantrum would work. You could say to some extent I was pretty spoilt even
            though my dad was a rather disciplined person.

            Anyways, I received Jesus back when one day when a thought came to me; I was at home and I was always encouraged to emulate the great men like Bill Gates, Steve Jobs etc. But something about that didn't make sense about that. At that moment the Holy Spirit brought to mind all the men in the Bible of equal or         perhaps greater greatness such as Abraham, Isaac, Solomon, David, Joseph etc and I drew a comparison between them and the successful men, who to me, had to relationship with God. I also looked at their lives and how they reached where they are. I thought and said to teh Lord, "Lord if you leave me to live my life how I want I know I'll make a mess of it. So please, I;ve been hearing about this Jesus guy in Sunday School a lot and I'd like to give my live to you so you could make something of it". On that fateful day, I was saved;I was about 9 years old then.

            Curse of my generation: mental illness - social anxiety, fear of men.
            My generation has a high number of mental illness of various kinds. The cause is simple, we don’t grow up
            like we’re suppose. It could be seen as a consequence of a new lifestyle, usually heavy interaction with
            technology and little with other people. While technology this isn’t inherently evil, it deprives them of
            one key part of life and that is human interaction.
            Such people have grown up developing only a 1/3 of their soul - the intellect. They often have the intellect
            part of the soul intact and highly functional, sometimes even better than “normal” people but the other 2/3,
            emotions and will, are under-developed, severely. As such they typically have no true desire of their own
            and everything is based of their intellect.
            God intended something different. Man’s original design was not isolation from his environment and but to
            rule over it. To interact with others and, chiefly, interact with God himself.

            Jesus Christ is the new ark; this flood/storm that is overwhelming the world is not from God but rather a
            consequence of our separation from him. Just like the Earth got flooded as a consequence of man’s separation
            from God and therein the wickedness that crops up.</p>

        <p>
            In the absence of God, the true god in our lives wickedness takes place and starts to ruin our lives.
        </p>

        <p>NOTE: Man becomes wicked because he no longer seeks God, Noah is an example of a man declared blameless
            because he sought after God all his life.
            Now in this flood, in this time where this curse has so ruined lives and relationships and minds, Jesus is
            the ark. God tell Noah: Genesis 6:18 But I will establish my covenant with you, and you will enter the
            ark—you and your sons and your wife and your sons’ wives with you.</p>
